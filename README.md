# Province of British Columbia - Web Application Inventory (PBCWAI)

PBCWAI is a simple web-based database application that empowers the
Province of British Columbia to track and manage their web applications.

The canonical home of PBCWAI is
<https://github.com/duncand/Darren-Duncan-IS24-full-stack-competition-req97073>.

## Structure

PBCWAI is implemented as a pair of TypeScript/JavaScript server
applications named `pbcwai-dbms` and `pbcwai-webapp`.

## Installation

These instructions assume a modern UNIX-like shell environment, like one
would have with a modern Linux or Apple MacOS system.  If you are using a
Microsoft Windows system, some alterations may be necessary.

### Prerequisite - Node.js

You should have Node.js <https://nodejs.org> installed.
A common way to do so is using your operating system's package manager,
or with Homebrew <https://brew.sh> in the case of MacOS.

This will provide the `npm` (Node Package Manager) utility and other tools
you would use for most setup or runtime tasks afterwards.

### Project Source Code

Obtain the latest source code for this project from its public repository at
<https://github.com/duncand/Darren-Duncan-IS24-full-stack-competition-req97073>.
You can use a `git` client to clone/pull it, or GitHub can privide a zip file.

All shell command sequences given here to setup or run PBCWAI itself assume
your starting current working directory is the root level of your clone of
this project's source folder, unless otherwise stated.
